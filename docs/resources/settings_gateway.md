# opnsense_settings_gateway (Resource)

Manage individual gateways under **System → Gateways → Single**.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opnsense_settings_gateway" "test" {
  name            = "TEST_123"
  interface       = "wan"
  ip_protocol     = "inet"
  description     = "Terraform managed gateway"
  priority        = 0
  weight          = 1
  monitor_disable = false
  disabled        = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Interface identifier (e.g., `wan`, `lan`) the gateway belongs to.
- `ip_protocol` (String) IP protocol of the gateway, usually `inet` for IPv4 or `inet6` for IPv6.
- `name` (String) Unique name for the gateway, e.g. `WAN_DHCP`.

### Optional

- `data_length` (Number) ICMP payload size in bytes for monitoring pings.
- `default_gateway` (Boolean) Set this gateway as default for the selected protocol. Defaults to `false`.
- `description` (String) Optional free-form description for your reference.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Disable this gateway. Defaults to `false`.
- `far_gateway` (Boolean) Allow the gateway to exist outside the interface subnet. Defaults to `false`.
- `force_down` (Boolean) Manually force the gateway status to down. Defaults to `false`.
- `gateway` (String) Gateway IP address. Leave empty for dynamic gateways that derive their address from the interface.
- `interval` (Number) Ping interval in seconds for monitoring.
- `latency_high` (Number) High latency threshold in milliseconds.
- `latency_low` (Number) Low latency threshold in milliseconds.
- `loss_high` (Number) High packet loss threshold as percentage.
- `loss_interval` (Number) Monitoring loss interval in milliseconds.
- `loss_low` (Number) Low packet loss threshold as percentage.
- `monitor` (String) Optional monitor IP address or host.
- `monitor_disable` (Boolean) Disable gateway monitoring. Defaults to `false`.
- `monitor_kill_states` (Boolean) Kill states when the gateway transitions to down. Defaults to `false`.
- `monitor_kill_states_priority` (Number) Optional priority to control state killing order across gateways.
- `monitor_no_route` (Boolean) Do not create monitoring routes automatically. Defaults to `false`.
- `priority` (Number) Gateway priority (lower is preferred).
- `time_period` (Number) Monitoring time period in seconds.
- `weight` (Number) Load balancing weight for the gateway.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) UUID of the gateway.
